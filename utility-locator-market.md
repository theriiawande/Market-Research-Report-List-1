<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Utility Locator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electromagnetic Field</li><li>Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The utility locator market primarily consists of two main types: electromagnetic field (EM) locators and ground penetrating radar (GPR). EM locators detect subsurface utilities by transmitting electromagnetic signals, which are reflected back from conductive materials, making them ideal for locating buried pipes and cables. GPR, on the other hand, uses radar pulses to generate images of subsurface structures, providing detailed information about the depth and composition of various utilities. Both technologies are essential for effective utility management and risk mitigation.</p></p>
